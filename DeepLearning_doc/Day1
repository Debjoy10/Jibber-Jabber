End to end Deep Learning Models


Neural networks-
Deep Learning involves mimicing how the human brain works
Neuron
Input layer->Neuron/Node->Output layer
Standardized/Normalize input variables
Synapses are assigned Weights
Weights are how neural networks learn
Weighted sum of the values
Then activation function is applied


Activation Functions-
Threshold function
Sigmoid function
Rectifier function
Tanh(Hyperbolic tangent function)	


Hidden Layers responsible for increased accuracy in neural nets
Batch and stochastic gradient method
Reinforcement learning and Batch learning

Epochs


Artificial Neural Networks-For regression and classification
Recurrent Neural Networks-For time series analysis 
Convolutional Neural Networks-For computer vision

ANN-Temporal Lobe-Memory
CNN-Occipital Lobe-Vision
RNN-Frontal Lobe-Short term memory

RNN-Neurons connected to themselves through time
