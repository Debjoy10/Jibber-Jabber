Stemming and Lemmitization
dogs-dog
jumping-jump

Stemming is more rigid
Wolves-Wolv

Lemmatizer is more accurate
Wolves-Wolf

NER(Named Entity Recognition)
Steve Jobs-Name
Apple-Organization


Latent semantic analysis(LSA)
synonymy-multiple words with same meaning
polysemy-one word with multiple meanings

Syonymy can be solved with LSA
Not that sure about polysemy

LSA is basically SVD on the term-document matrix
SVD and PCA
PCA-Principal Component Analysis
SVD-Singular Value Decomposition
Matrix * Vector= Vector in possibly different direction(Same vectors in different coordinate system)
Features of PCA-
Decorrelates input data
Transformed data is ordered by information content(First dimension carries most information,2nd carries 2nd most)
Dimensionality reduction 
Denoising/smoothing

Wrote a program to perform SVD on a dataset which contained titles of books.
An example of unsupervised learning.



Article Spinning
Holy grail of internet marketing.
Automated
Content generation
Taking existing articles and modifying them so that new won't match original,for example,replacing words with their synonyms.
Using trigrams-Use previous and next word to predict current word.
Unsupervised learning
The spun article doesn't make much sense.Hence we need to look more than the neighbouring words.
We first made trigrams by assigning previous and next word to a tuple and the middle word is the value of that tuple in a list.
Then we calculated probability of each word and then mapped it to its trigram.
Now we took a random review and took words with probability less than 0.2 and replaced them with random words.


Not covered topics:
Edit distance-Insertion,deletion and substitution
Parsing trees
MaxEnt classifiers-Maximum Entropy






Crash blossoms-Sentences with ambiguous meaning(Literal and figurative sense)
Text processing-
Regular Expressions-A formal language for specifying text strings
Disjunctions-Woodchuck,woodchuck,woodchucks,Woodchucks
[Ww]oodchuck
Negation in disjunction
[^Ab]-Not A or b

looked | step = looked or step
colou?r = Optional previous character = color or colour
oo*h = O or more of previous character = oh or ooh or oooh or ooooh
o+h= 1 or more of previous character = oh or ooh or oooh
beg.n=begin or begun or beg3n
^[A-Z]=letter at start of line
[A-Z]$=letter at end of line


Minimizing false positives and false negatives are our objectives
