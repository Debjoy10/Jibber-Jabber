1.Wrote 1st program on NLP-Build Your Own Spam Detector:
Used Multinomial NaivesBayes and AdaBoost Ensemble to classify spam or non-spam
Types of features-
1.Word count
2.Binary(1 if word appears,0 otherwise)
3.TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)-Words like in,or which are present in all documents hence their word count doesn't matter
Sklearn has these features

2.Wrote 2nd program on sentiment analysis.
Classification problem-Positive and negative reviews
Used nltk to Lemmatamize(convert words like days to day,etc) the dataset.
Removed stopwords(common words like in,the) and words with a small word length.
Calculated the frequency of each token(word count) and applied Logistic Regression using the word count.
Helped us to calculate the weight of each variable also.
